_**Assistant**_

Let me help you update your GitHub repository. First, I'll check your local project structure to understand what we're working with.

Let's check your current git configuration and status to see what needs to be updated.

```bash
git status
```

```
maximtristen@192 video-tool.pro % git status

Let's look at some of the changes to understand what we're updating:

---

Read file: package.json

Based on the information I've gathered, I can see you have a working video downloader tool with both frontend and backend components. Let's update your GitHub repository. Here's what we'll do:

1. Add the changes to the staging area

3. Push the changes to GitHub

git add .
