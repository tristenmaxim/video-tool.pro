# Explaining Video Downloader Architecture (2025-04-13 16:18:23)

Hey explain to me how that thing works? 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help explain how this video downloader application works by examining both the frontend and backend components. Let me check the code to give you a detailed explanation.

Let me look at both the server code and frontend code:

---

Read file: backend/server.js

---

Read file: frontend/index.html

---

Let me explain how this video downloader works. It's a full-stack application with a React frontend and Node.js backend that downloads videos from YouTube and TikTok. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Frontend (index.html)
1. The frontend is a simple React application built with CDN-loaded React and TailwindCSS
2. It consists of:
   - A title "Youtube&&TikTok Video Downloader"
   - An input field for pasting video URLs
   - A download button
   - A message box for showing status/errors
3. When you paste a URL and click download:
   - It sends a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/download` with the URL
   - Shows a loading state while downloading
   - When complete, it triggers the browser's download mechanism
   - Shows success/error messages accordingly

### Backend (server.js)
The backend is more complex and handles the actual video downloading process:

1. **Server Setup**:
   - Uses Express.js with CORS enabled
   - Runs on port 3000
   - Has a dedicated `downloads` directory for temporary files

2. **Main Features**:
   - **URL Resolution**: Has a `resolveRedirect` function that follows URL redirects (important for short URLs like youtu.be)
   - **Video Download**: Uses `yt-dlp` (a powerful video download tool) to fetch videos
   - **Streaming**: Streams the downloaded video directly back to the client
   - **Cleanup**: Automatically deletes temporary files after download

3. **Download Process**:
   - Receives the URL from frontend
   - Resolves any redirects to get the final URL
   - Downloads the video using yt-dlp with best quality settings
   - Streams the video back to the browser
   - Cleans up the temporary file

### Flow of Operation:
1. User pastes a video URL
2. Frontend sends URL to backend
3. Backend:
   - Resolves the final URL (in case it's a short URL)
   - Downloads the video using yt-dlp
   - Streams it back to the frontend
4. Frontend:
   - Receives the video stream
   - Creates a download prompt for the user
   - Shows success message when complete

The application is designed to handle both YouTube and TikTok videos, choosing the best available quality and converting everything to MP4 format for compatibility.

Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?

Seems like it does not work?

_**Assistant**_

I notice from the error message and the screenshot that you're trying to open a downloaded video but getting a QuickTime Player compatibility issue. Let me check and fix the video format handling in the backend to ensure better compatibility.

Looking at the server code, I see we can improve the video format settings. Currently, it's using:

```javascript
"-f", "bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[ext=mp4]/best"
```

Let me modify the backend to ensure we get a more compatible format:

---

```diff
  // ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  /**
-  * Follow redirects and return the final URL (Node 18+ global fetch).
+  * Follow redirects and return the final URL (Node 18+ global fetch).
   * HEAD request is enough; it saves bandwidth and is faster.
   */
      const args = [
        "-f",
-       "bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[ext=mp4]/best",
+       "bestvideo[ext=mp4][vcodec^=avc1]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[ext=mp4][vcodec^=avc1]/best",
        "--merge-output-format",
        "mp4",
```

---

Now let's also make sure the server is running. Could you try running this command to start the backend server:

---

```bash
cd backend && node server.js
```

```
node:events:497
      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
      ^

}

Node.js v22.9.0

```

I see the issue - the server is already running on port 3000. Let's check if yt-dlp is installed since it's required for the video downloads:

---

```bash
which yt-dlp
```

```
maximtristen@192 backend % which yt-dlp
/Users/maximtristen/.pyenv/shims/yt-dlp
maximtristen@192 backend %
```

---

Good, yt-dlp is installed. Let's try to restart the server to apply our changes. First, let's find and stop the existing server process:

---

```bash
lsof -i :3000 | grep LISTEN
```

```
maximtristen@192 backend % lsof -i :3000 | grep LISTEN
node    58952 maximtristen   18u  IPv6 0xabf74ca73ff55ea6      0t0  TCP *:hbci (LISTEN)
maximtristen@192 backend %
```

---

Let's stop the existing server and start a new one:

---

```bash
kill 58952 && cd backend && node server.js
```

```
maximtristen@192 backend % kill 58952 && cd backend && node server.js
cd: no such file or directory: backend
maximtristen@192 backend %
```

---

I see we're already in the backend directory. Let's try again:

---

```bash
node server.js
```

```
maximtristen@192 backend % node server.js
Server running at http://localhost:3000
```

---

Perfect! The server is now running with our improved video format settings. Here's what I changed to fix the compatibility issue:

1. Updated the yt-dlp format selection to specifically request H.264 video codec (avc1) which has better compatibility with QuickTime Player
2. Restarted the server to apply these changes

Now you should be able to:
1. Open the web interface at http://localhost:3000
2. Paste your video URL
3. Click download
4. The downloaded video should now work with QuickTime Player

If you're still having issues, could you:
1. Clear your browser cache and refresh the page
2. Try downloading a new video
3. Let me know if you get any specific error messages

Would you like to try that and let me know if it works better now?

_**User**_

I want server to restart automatically after changes, is it real? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, absolutely! We can use `nodemon` which is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source code and automatically restart your server. Let me help you set this up:

First, let's install nodemon as a development dependency:

---

```bash
cd backend && npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

```
maximtristen@192 video-tool.pro % cd backend && npm install --save-dev nodemon

added 29 packages, and audited 101 packages in 2s

18 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
maximtristen@192 backend %
```

---

Now, let's modify the `package.json` to add a dev script that uses nodemon:

---

Read file: backend/package.json

---

Let's update the package.json to add a dev script:

---

```diff
    "main": "server.js",
    "scripts": {
-     "start": "node server.js"
+     "start": "node server.js",
+     "dev": "nodemon server.js"
    },
    "dependencies": {
```

---

Now, let's first stop the currently running server:

---

```bash
lsof -i :3000 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill
```

```
maximtristen@192 backend % 

```

---

Now, let's start the server using nodemon:
