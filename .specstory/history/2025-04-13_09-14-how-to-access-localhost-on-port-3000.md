Based on the code I found, I can help you run the application. Before running it, you'll need to:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Have `yt-dlp` installed on your system (as the backend uses it for video downloads)

To start the server, you can run either of these commands from the root directory of the project:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
node backend/server.js
```

Once the server is running, you can open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see a web interface where you can paste YouTube or TikTok URLs to download videos.

If you haven't installed the dependencies yet, you should first run:
```bash
npm run install-deps
```

This will install all the necessary Node.js packages for both the frontend and backend.

Would you like me to help you with any of these steps?
